- I need an application that downloads the youtube transcript using https://pypi.org/project/youtube-transcript-api/
- The transcript will be stored in a Vector DB
- Then we will do RAG on the data.

I need you to come up with an execution plan that's doable. We need a working prototype that can be build in the shortest amount of time.

- Can we develop a UI that lists all the downloaded Videos?
- When I click the Video, I see the transcript downloaded for the Video.
